# Legible

An experiment in a randomly generated, UUID-like identifier format.

## The Concept

IDs are generated by randomly selecting trigrams extracted from a source language text.
This lets you generate almost-pronounceable strings, while keeping a firm handle on
the entropy of the generated IDs.

Source texts are provided for English, Spanish, and Sindarin. Try it out:

```
<spanish.txt ./segmentize.rb | ./generate.rb
```
